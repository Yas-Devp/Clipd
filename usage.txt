welcome to usage tutorial ;

if the app doesn't show , check if any new appears in your linux panel or toolbar , click it to show the main window ;
if no icon appears , open main.cpp using any text editor then change :

change : window.hide();
to -> window.show();

it will work without problems , enjoy :)
